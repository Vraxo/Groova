ItemList's vertical horizontal only responds to
clicks when Clickable is on Ready, not Start. Why?

This is preventing me from switching click manager
from Ready to Start, which would remove the need for
checking if the clickable is active, which is there
because deactivated unshown items in ItemLists never
run their Ready method and therefore don't get their
click manager.

Make padding in button style to text origin for textbox

Add a way to access window resolution without raylib

* when left & right click are both enabled on a button,
  the button only changes color on pressed on right clicks.
