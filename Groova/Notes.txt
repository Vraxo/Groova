This is preventing me from switching click manager
from Ready to Start, which would remove the need for
checking if the clickable is active, which is there
because deactivated unshown items in ItemLists never
run their Ready method and therefore don't get their
click manager.

* add rapid deletion to textbox

* make on update a universal thing

* remove flicker from first time seeing item list items



* horizontal slider button is one pixel high

* make horizontal slider work with origins

* clickable start needs to be called before adding children,
  otherwise the node itself will the last node and therefore
  absorb the clicks.
